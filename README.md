# ImportManager

> **Note** This is a work in progress.

The idea of this program is to replace the bash script [dtcp.bash](https://gist.github.com/mproffitt/d720a1a513cd3155316783a023f0edf2)

The original idea of `dtcp.bash` was to listen to an images "input" folder, then sort the images to a new
workbench location based on their filetype.

This program represents an idea to enhance that for managing multiple filetypes based on rules defined
against the mimetype for that file (group or category).
